Air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials.
This dataset provides you the pollution in the U.S. It contains daily data for the four major pollutants NO2, O3, SO2 and CO each has 5 specific columns during 2006 and 2010. 


## üìÑ **OBJECTIVE**
Air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials.
This dataset provides you the pollution in the U.S. It contains daily data for the four major pollutants NO2, O3, SO2 and CO each has 5 specific columns during 2006 and 2010. 










## üìÑ**Data Quest**
 

- Display all 4 pollutants with action-page navigation.  
- Add slicers for states, cities, counties, and affected years.  
- Create a filled map for US states.  
- Generate a table of county names with codes.  
- Show quarter-wise bifurcation of pollutants.  

#### Carbon Monoxide (CO):  
- Identify top 10 states with highest CO pollutants.  
- Display 1st max hour and 1st max value using cards.  
- Show CO units in a card.  
- Create a table of CO AQI per state code.  
- Chart maximum CO in each state and year-wise line chart for CO AQI.  
- Find the top CO-pollutant city.  
- Add interactive slicers for states and a synced slicer for date range analysis.  

#### Ozone (O‚ÇÉ):  
- Identify top 10 states with highest O‚ÇÉ pollutants.  
- Display 1st max hour and 1st max value using cards.  
- Show O‚ÇÉ units in a card.  
- Create a table of O‚ÇÉ AQI per state code.  
- Chart maximum O‚ÇÉ in each state and year-wise line chart for O‚ÇÉ AQI.  
- Find the top O‚ÇÉ-pollutant city.  
- Add interactive slicers for states and a synced slicer for date range analysis.  

#### Sulphur Dioxide (SO‚ÇÇ):  
- Identify top 10 states and cities with highest SO‚ÇÇ pollutants.  
- Display 1st max hour and 1st max value using cards.  
- Show SO‚ÇÇ units in a card.  
- Create a table of SO‚ÇÇ AQI per state code.  
- Chart maximum SO‚ÇÇ in each state and year-wise line chart for SO‚ÇÇ AQI.  
- Find the top SO‚ÇÇ-pollutant city.  
- Add interactive slicers for states and a synced slicer for date range analysis.  

#### Nitrogen Dioxide (NO‚ÇÇ):  
- Identify top 10 states with highest NO‚ÇÇ pollutants.  
- Display 1st max hour and 1st max value using cards.  
- Show NO‚ÇÇ units in a card.  
- Create a table of NO‚ÇÇ AQI per state code.  
- Chart maximum NO‚ÇÇ in each state and year-wise line chart for NO‚ÇÇ AQI.  
- Add interactive slicers for states and a synced slicer for date range analysis.

## üìù **CONCLUSION**

This project explores air pollution across the United States, focusing on key pollutants: Carbon Monoxide (CO), Ozone (O‚ÇÉ), Sulphur Dioxide (SO‚ÇÇ), and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO‚ÇÇ). Using Power BI, the dashboard provides interactive insights through:

* Page Navigation: Seamless navigation between pollutant-specific pages for deeper analysis.

* Geospatial Analysis: A filled map visualizes pollution trends across U.S. states.

* Interactive Slicers: Enables filtering by states, counties, and specific dates for precise insights.

* Quarter-Wise Analysis: Displays pollutant levels across different quarters using pie charts.

This interactive and visually rich analysis highlights the power of data visualization in understanding complex environmental data.
